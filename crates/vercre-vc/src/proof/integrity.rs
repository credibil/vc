//! # VC Data Integrity
//!
//! ## Generic Data Integrity Structure
//!
//! The operation of Data Integrity is conceptually simple. To create a cryptographic
//! proof, the following steps are performed: 1) Transformation, 2) Hashing, and 3)
//! Proof Generation.
//!
//! Transformation is a process described by a transformation algorithm that takes input
//! data and prepares it for the hashing process. In the case of data serialized in JSON
//! this transformation includes the removal of all the artifacts that do not influence
//! the semantics of the data like spaces, new lines, the order of JSON names, etc. (a
//! step often referred to as canonicalization). In some cases the transformation may be
//! more involved.
//!
//! Hashing is a process described by a hashing algorithm that calculates an identifier
//! for the transformed data using a cryptographic hash function. Typically, the size of
//! the resulting hash is smaller than the data, which makes it more suitable for
//! complex cryptographic functions like digital signatures.
//!
//! Proof Generation is a process described by a proof method that calculates a value
//! that protects the integrity of the input data from modification or otherwise proves
//! a certain desired threshold of trust. A typical example is the application of a
//! cryptographic signature using asymmetric keys, yielding the signature of the data.
//!
//! Verification of a proof involves repeating the same steps on the verifier's side and,
//! depending on the proof method, validating the newly calculated proof value with the
//! one associated with the data. In the case of a digital signature, this test usually
//! means comparing the calculated signature value with the one which is embedded in the
//! data.

//! ## VC Data Integrity
//!
//! The Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0 [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY] specification
//! relies on the general structure and defines a set of standard properties describing
//! the details of the proof generation process. The specific details (canonicalization
//! algorithm, hash and/or proof method algorithms, etc.) are defined by separate
//! cryptosuites. The Working Group has defined a number of such cryptosuites as
//! separate specifications, see 4.2.3 Cryptosuites below.
//!
//! The core property, in the general structure, is proof. This property embeds a claim
//! in the Credential, referring to a separate collection of claims (referred to as a
//! Proof Graph) detailing all the claims about the proof itself:
