//! Securing Credentials
//!
//! Verifiable Credentials can be secured using two different mechanisms: enveloping
//! proofs or embedded proofs. In both cases, a proof cryptographically secures a
//! Credential (for example, using digital signatures). In the enveloping case,
//! the proof wraps around the Credential, whereas embedded proofs are included in the
//! serialization, alongside the Credential itself.
//!
//! ## Envelooping Proofs
//!
//! A family of enveloping proofs is defined in the [Securing Verifiable Credentials
//! using JOSE and COSE] document, relying on technologies defined by
//! the IETF. Other types of enveloping proofs may be specified by the community.
//!
//! ## Embedded Proofs
//!
//! The general structure for embedded proofs is defined in a separate [Verifiable
//! Credential Data Integrity 1.0] specification. Furthermore, some instances of this
//! general structure are specified in the form of the "cryptosuites": Data Integrity
//! [EdDSA Cryptosuites v1.0], Data Integrity [ECDSA Cryptosuites v1.0], and Data
//! Integrity [BBS Cryptosuites v1.0].
