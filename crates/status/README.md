# Verifiable Credential Status

Shared types and logic for working with Verifiable Credential status.

This crate has helper types and methods that can be used directly for the publishing of a
[Bitstring Status List](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/). The types for configuration
and management of the status list log might also be useful for other status list methods. 

For the main Vercre crates for verifiable credential issuer, verifier and holder agents, see
