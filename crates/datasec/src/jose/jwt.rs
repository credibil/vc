//! # JSON Web Token (JWT)
//!
//! JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing
//! claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a JWT
//! are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON
//! Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web
//! Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally
//! signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code
//! (MAC) and/or encrypted.
