# Stability

Credibil VC's stability is a reflection of the process of change in supported features,
platforms, as well as internal structure. This section should provide some insight
as to expectations of the maintainers regarding change in Credibil VC.

For Credibil VC, the stability of the API is primarily affected by:

* The process of change — introducing or deprecating features and platforms

* The number of supported features and platforms — the greater the number, the higher
  the risk a change will impact some users.

In the following sections , we outline our management of this change — from instigation
through to release.
