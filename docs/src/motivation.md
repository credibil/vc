# Motivation

While decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials have been around for several years, integrating these technologies into existing identity systems has not been without its challenges.

The introduction of the OpenID for [Verifiable Credentials Issuance](<https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html>) and [Verifiable Presentations](<https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html>) standards provides a straightforward approach to issuing, holding, and verifying credentials.

## Our Contribution

We hope to hasten the adoption of privacy-respecting, digital trust ecosystems by providing a simple, easy-to-use libraries for developers to integrate these technologies into their applications.

By settling on the OpenID standards, we are making a (safe?) bet on the not inconsiderable base of OpenID-based systems and libraries that have been developed over the years. We hope to leverage this existing infrastructure to make it easier for developers to integrate Verifiable Credentials into their applications.
