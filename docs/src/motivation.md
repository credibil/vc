# Motivation

While decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials have been around for several years, integrating these new technologies into existing identity systems has presented a challenge.

The introduction of OpenID for [Verifiable Credentials Issuance](<https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html>) and [Verifiable Presentations](<https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html>) standards provides a straightforward approach to issuing, holding, and verifying credentials.

## Our Solution

We hope to hasten the adoption of privacy-respecting, digital trust ecosystems by providing a simple, easy-to-use libraries for developers to integrate these technologies into their applications.
